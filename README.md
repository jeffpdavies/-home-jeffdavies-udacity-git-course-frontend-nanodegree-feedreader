## Testing using Jasmine

# A Udacity FEND project

This project demonstrates browser based testing using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).


## Steps to run

Open `index.html` in the browser of your choice.
It may take some time to completely load as additional network requests are made.
Once loaded, test results should be displayed at the bottom of the page.
